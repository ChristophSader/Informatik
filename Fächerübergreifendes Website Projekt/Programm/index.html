			  <p>The boy at the top of the mountain is about a boy who is called Pierrot he lives with his French mother and his German father in Paris in 1936.
			  In Paris he has also a deaf Jewish friend who loves to write story’s.</br> </br> 
			 At the beginning of the story we become insight in the life of Pierrot and there we find out that the father fought in the first grate War and after the war he married a French woman. 
			  Later in the story the father dies. After the death of the father, the mother is left alone with Pierrot and she starts to work harder and in the end she dies too.</br></br> 
			  So Pierrot now is alone and is sent to an orphanage in French. 
			  After a short time he is sent to an aunt who is called Beatrix, she lives in Austria and is a housekeeper in a large property in the Bavarian mountains.</br> </br>
			  On arrival, Beatrix asks Pierrot to go by the name Peter and to forget about his French roots. He is quickly won over by the charisma of his aunt´s employer, by the 
			  pageantry of the Hitler Youth, by the sense of his superiority that his father´s bloodline offershim.</br> </br>It does not take him long to transform into a cold and callous teenager.
			  In fact the process is almost uncomfortably speedy and so easily swayed is Pierrot by the trappings of power that he conducts betrayal after betrayal,
			  too smug to realise that his actions will have lasting repercussions on those he loves and on his own conscience.</br></br> 
			  But who is the master?</br>  How much more will Pierrot change in this Mansion?</br>  Are you interested in the book?</br>  Then stop reading my Site and start reading the book and we will see us later!!</br> <a style="cursor:pointer;" href="https://www.amazon.de/Boy-at-Top-Mountain/dp/1627790306" target="blank" class ="link">Click here to buy the book on Amazon!!!</a></p></br>

				  <p>The Main Character of the story is Pierrot Fischer, at the beginning of the storie he
				   is 7 years old and is living in Paris in 1936 with his French mother and his German
				 father.</br>
				  Because of the deaths of his mother and his father he is left alone in the harsh world
				   of 1936.</br></br> 
				   His short time in the orphanage is difficult for him because he is a small little boy
				  who is not capable of defending himself. After the short time in the orphanage Pierrot
				  is sent to his Aunt in Austria where his life changes irrevocably.</br>
				
					In Austria his nam changes from Pierrot to Pieter, because it is more German like. Also
					 his clothes change to traditional German attire and he is never allowed to talk about
					 his French roots especially about Anshel. This changes are important because the Berghof where the book
					takes place is the country home of Adolf Hitler.</br>
					
					During the nine years that Pieter is acquainted with Hitler, the Führers influence on
					 him grows. This influence alters Pieter´s toughts, shapes his beliefs and, ultimately,
					 dictates his choices and actions.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="modal-body2">
		 
			<p>John Boyne examines the events of the World War 2 and the Holocaust through the eyes
			  of the child or an innocent. But unlike “THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS”, our book
			  takes a much more critical stance on what it means to be innocent and who is culpable
			  for the atrocities commited during this time period.</br> 
			Our main Protagonist Pieter represents all those who became aware of Hitler´s actions
			over the course of time, but did nothing to stop them. Pieter enters the berghof as an
			 innocent child who is unaware of the differences between people but nine years later
			 he leaves the Berghof well aware of the supposed differences between people and the
			 steps the Führer took to purify his people and eliminate these differences.</br>
			 The boy at the top of the Mountain is just like Boyne´s "THE BOY IN THE STRIPED 
			PAJAMAS", it adds a fresh and important viewpoint on the World War 2 and the Holocaust
			 for readers of all ages. But like all grerat literature, the questions and themes that
			 arise in the book can be applied across situations and time periods. And are, in many
			 ways, just as relevant, if not more relevant, to today than to the setting of the book.</p>

				<p> The book "THE BOY AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN" is a great work of John Boyne,
				it shows us the World during the World War 2 through the eyes of a child, who still doesn´t know 
				what is right and what is wrong, who is bad and who is good, does bad people even excist?</br>I gave the 
				book 4 stars because I think John Boyne described a difficult topic with a understandable writtig stile.
				So also i who is not so good at english like others, could follow the book perfectly.
				I recommend the book for everyone, because the Atuor doesn´t use difficult words so everyone can understand the book. Even if you are not so
				good at English!</p>
